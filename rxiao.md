Pets are what people raise and feed for accompany and emotion needs. Among them, there are good pets like cat, dog, and horse.  They are very different animals,for example, the size of these animals varies a lot. Average weight for dogs can be like 50 pounds -100pounds, where horses can be around 840 -2200 pounds and cats can be as light as 8 pounds average. Although they are all different in shape, size, or even species, they all have good relationship with human.

### CATS

#### Relationship With Human

Cats are common pets throughout the world, and their worldwide population exceeds 500 million.Although cat guardianship has commonly been associated with women, a 2007 Gallup poll that men and women in the United States of America were equally likely to own a cat.

As well as being kept as pets, cats are also used in the international fur and leather industries for making coats, hats, blankets, and stuffed toys; and shoes, gloves, and musical instruments respectively (about 24 cats are needed to make a cat-fur coat). This use has been outlawed in the United States, Australia, and the European Union. Cat pelts have been used for superstitious purposes as part of the practice of witchcraft, and are still made into blankets in Switzerland as folk remedies believed to help rheumatism. In the Western intellectual tradition, the idea of cats as everyday objects have served to illustrate problems of quantum mechanics in the Schr√∂dinger's cat thought experiment.

### DOGS

#### Relationship with Human

It is estimated that three-quarters of the world's dog population lives in the developing world as feral, village, or community dogs, with pet dogs uncommon.

"The most widespread form of interspecies bonding occurs between humans and dogs"and the keeping of dogs as companions, particularly by elites, has a long history. (As a possible example, at the Natufian culture site of Ain. dated to 12,000 BC, the remains of an elderly human and a four-to-five-month-old puppy were found buried together).However, pet dog populations grew significantly after World War II as suburbanization increased. In the 1950s and 1960s, dogs were kept outside more often than they tend to be today (using the expression "in the doghouse" to describe exclusion from the group signifies the distance between the doghouse and the home) and were still primarily functional, acting as a guard, children's playmate, or walking companion. From the 1980s, there have been changes in the role of the pet dog, such as the increased role of dogs in the emotional support of their human guardians. People and dogs have become increasingly integrated and implicated in each other's lives,to the point where pet dogs actively shape the way a family and home are experienced.

### HORSES

#### Relationship with Human

Worldwide, horses play a role within human cultures and have done so for millennia. The genetic makeup of the human population in a geographical area is affected by the presence or absence of horses (more variation in Africa, less in Eurasian steppes). Societies where horse riding is an integral part of life have developed traditional attires specially suited for horse riding such as tightly wrapping waistband or Cummerbunds giving wide support useful for protecting the spine during long journeys, and voluminous headgear such as turban to protect the skull during falls from the horse. Horses are used for leisure activities, sports, and working purposes. The FAO estimates that in 2008, there were almost 59,000,000 horses in the world, with around 33,500,000 in the Americas, 13,800,000 in Asia and 6,300,000 in Europe and smaller portions in Africa and Oceania. There are estimated to be 9,500,000 horses in the United States alone.
